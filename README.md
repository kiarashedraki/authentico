# Authentico

Authentico is a Node.js authentication service designed to provide secure and scalable user management for web applications. It leverages Express.js and Passport.js to handle authentication workflows efficiently, offering both local and potentially other strategies for managing user sessions.

## Project Structure

- **`app.js`**: The entry point of the application. It sets up the server and integrates the middleware and routes.
- **`config/`**:
  - **`passport-setup.js`**: Configuration for Passport strategies, including OAuth or local strategies.
- **`models/`**:
  - **`User.js`**: Defines the user schema and model for MongoDB.
- **`routes/`**:
  - **`auth.js`**: Handles authentication routes such as login, logout, and signup.
  - **`profile.js`**: Manages routes for user profiles after authentication.
- **`package.json`**: Declares npm dependencies and scripts.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Provides version history for all installed packages.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation guide for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- NPM

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authentico.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd authentico
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the server with:
```
npm start
```
Ensure that your MongoDB service is running and that `app.js` is configured to connect to your database correctly. You will also need to set up your environment variables in a `.env` file for any API keys or database URIs.
